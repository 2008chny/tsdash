BUILD
=====

to build each of the parts, run "ant" on each directory. For deployment you need any Servlet container; we used Tomcat 7.0.20.

The two parts can also be imported in Eclipse (File > Import > Existing project into workspace) as separate projects. For the UI, Google Eclipse Plugin must be installed before importing the project.
